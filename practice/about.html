                What is the SuperMemo Company About?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The SuperMemo method, which is the basis of all our courses, was created in the '80s by Piotr Woźniak —
                a young, talented scientist and student of molecular biology who needed an effective way to learn
                biochemistry and … English vocabulary. In 1991, we became the first company in the world to start using
                spaced repetition to aid learners and provide them with a better memorisation process. Today, our
                solution is still an inspiration for almost the entire education industry. Quoted from <a

                How to use SuperMemo.com
            </h3>
            <p>
                Start a course from the LEARN section — by learning new material.
                After each card, evaluate the degree to which you have learned a word or rule using the buttons: I KNOW,
                I DON’T KNOW, ALMOST.
                The SuperMemo algorithm uses this information to select the best moments for you to repeat small
                portions of information — that is, when you almost start to forget them. It then arranges them
                appropriately in the REPEAT section.
                The better you remember given information, the longer intervals the algorithm sets between each
                repetition, and your knowledge is gradually consolidated in long-term memory.
                TIP: Remember that spaced repetitions are the basis of permanent and fast memorisation using the
                SuperMemo method. Your learning progress depends on them. If you have a bad day, when you lack the
                strength and will, skip learning new cards and focus on the REPEAT section instead. Doing even a few
                repetitions will be a step forward!
