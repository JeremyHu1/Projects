				What is SuperMemo?
			</h2>
			<p>
				SuperMemo (from "Super Memory") is a learning method and software package developed by SuperMemo World
				and SuperMemo R&D with Piotr Wo≈∫niak in Poland from 1985 to the present.[2] It is based on research into
				long-term memory, and is a practical application of the spaced repetition learning method that has been
				proposed for efficient instruction by a number of psychologists as early as in the 1930s.[3]

			<h3>
				How to use SuperMemo
			</h3>
			<p>
				The SuperMemo program stores a database of questions and answers constructed by the user. When reviewing
				information saved in the database, the program uses the SuperMemo algorithm to decide what questions to
				show the user. The user then answers the question and rates their relative ease of recall - with grades
				of 0 to 5 (0 is the hardest, 5 is the easiest) - and their rating is used to calculate how soon they
				should be shown the question again. While the exact algorithm varies with the version of SuperMemo, in
				general, items that are harder to remember show up more frequently.[2]

				Besides simple text questions and answers, the latest version of SuperMemo supports images, video, and
				HTML questions and answers.[6]

				Since 2000,[5] SuperMemo has had a unique set of features that distinguish it from other spaced
				repetition programs, called incremental reading (IR or "increading"[7]). Whereas earlier versions were
				built around users entering information they wanted to use, using IR, users can import text that they
				want to learn from. The user reads the text inside of SuperMemo, and tools are provided to bookmark
				one's location in the text and automatically schedule it to be revisited later, extract valuable
				information, and turn extracts into questions for the user to learn. By automating the entire process of
				reading and extracting knowledge to be remembered all in the same program, time is saved from having to
				manually prepare information, and insights into the nature of learning can be used to make the entire
				process more natural for the user. Furthermore, since the process of extracting knowledge can often lead
				to the extraction of more information than can actually be feasibly remembered, a priority system is
				implemented that allows the user to ensure that the most important information is remembered when they
				can't review all information in the system.[8]
